# pepp-fuzz

## Overview
The `pepp-fuzz` module is designed to perform fuzz testing on the backend of the application. 

## Fuzzing Strategy
The fuzzing strategy involves creating various fuzzing functions that target different parts of the backend. These functions will generate random inputs and monitor the application's behavior to identify any crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Setup Requirements
1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pepp-fuzz
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Running Fuzz Tests
To run the fuzz tests, use the following command:
```
go test -fuzz=Fuzz<FunctionName>
```
Replace `<FunctionName>` with the name of the fuzzing function you want to execute.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the fuzzing tests or improve the project are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
